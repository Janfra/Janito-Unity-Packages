# Editor Extras Package
This package aims to include useful reusable code targeting the Unity Editor that I am personally using on projects or in my other packages.

All code is a result of my learning on extending the editor; there may be errors or oversights; I'll fix them as I become aware of them. Please do reach out with any problems or suggestions!
